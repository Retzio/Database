Forms
--------------------------------

-The DashBoard
The DashBoard will be the first thing to load up. 
You are free to click on the forms in any order but they will be listed here in the order displayed
You are also free to navigate to other forms in the currently opened form via the menu bar.


-Brokers (Sub-Form)

This subform will allow the user to see all listings for every broker. 
This allows the user to also see how many total listings as well as how the total amount of properties the broker has sold. 
We are also able to see the days on market to understand how long the broker usually takes to conduct a transaction. 
On the form, you will also be able to search by first and last name for convenience. 


-Investors (Detail Form) 

This form is the Investor Detail Form, and this provides more information on the broker such as contact information and mailing address. 
You will be able to search for an investor by the first or the last name here for convenience. 
 
 
-Transactions (Data Grid Form) 

This form displays all of the transactions giving details on who was the Investor and who was the broker the date it was conducted and the commission that the broker made from it. 
 

-Search Portfolios (Search Form)

The search form will allow the user to dive into each investor's current portfolio and look and a multitude of aggerates, based on the property type. 
This will allow the advisors to pinpoint what property type the investor is best at managing as well as properties the investor may be struggling with. 
If the user does not click on any of the properties it will ask the user to check at least one property. 
The user can also look at the bottom or top percent of properties based on value and select the desired percent they want to see. 
When the search button is clicked a graph will display the percentage of total portfolio value for each property type. 



Reports
--------------------------------
If you wish to view the reports open up the Reports folder in the Solution Explorer.
Click on either the Listings or Investor's Loans reports and click display if not already opened

-Listing
The Listing report will automatically show all current listings.
If you click the drop-down at the top you can switch to "pending" and "sold" listings as well.
The goal of the Report is for when Investors are looking to buy new properties an agent can pull up this report or print it off to go tour all the houses.
Due to the report's intended use if you click on any of the addresses in the report it will take you to google maps to direct you to the property and also give you a street view of the property.
Because all of these addresses are mock addresses most of the links won't be able to find an actual house, but it is structured so that if an actual address was in the data it would pull that house up.
There are a few that do pull up actual addresses though such as 9 Oxford Terrace, Denver 80255
There are some basic details about the property as well as financial information on the property to go over with investors while showing the houses.


-Investor's Loans
The Investor's Loans form allows Brokers to dive into the loans that each broker currently has pulled and exam all of the financial components to it.
The type of loan you pull for a house can have huge positive and negative effects on your ROI so this allows the Brokers to make sure the Investor is in the best situation possible
Allowing the Broker to advise the Investor to recommend refinancing or pulling a certain type of loan if the Investor qualifies will free up time and stress for both parties.
Financial functions were used as well to present more relevant data.
